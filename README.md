## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool
- Mobile-first workflow
- Frontend Mentor starter template design

### What I learned

One of the main challenges was creating a responsive component while also ensuring that it was built efficiently and without unnecessary repetition. This helped me improve my ability to break down UI into reusable, maintainable components.

I also learned how to build responsive components using Tailwind CSS and practiced applying atomic design principles in React to structure components effectively.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to add subtle animations and improve the alert/feedback appearance after the rating is submitted, to enhance the overall user experience.
